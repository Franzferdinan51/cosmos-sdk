# The maximum gas amount can be spent for contract query.
# The contract query will invoke contract execution vm,
# so we need to restrict the max usage to prevent DoS attack

# Only The logs from the contracts listed in this array
# are stored in the local storage. To keep all logs,
# a node operator can set "*" (not recommended).

# Storing instances in the LRU will have no effect on the results 
# (still deterministic), but should lower execution time at 
# the cost of increased memory usage. We cannot pick universal 
# parameters for this, so we should allow node operators to set it.
